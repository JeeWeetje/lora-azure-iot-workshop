# From device to actionable insights with LoRa and the Azure IoT platform

## Getting started with the The Things Uno and The Things Network

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture01-overview.png)

In this chapter you will configure the The Things Uno with two sensors, connect it to The Things Network platform. On the The Things platform you will provision the The Things Uno, receive its messages and decode the telemetry. As final step in this chapter you will deploy a bridge between the The Things Network platform and Microsoft Azure IoT platform.

*Note: In this workshop, we will create uniquely named Azure resources. The suggested names could be reserved already. Just try another unique name.*

## Connect your device

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture02-build-the-hardware.png)

Follow the workshop facilitator connecting the two sensors. A few important things:

- The Button red cable is connected to the `3.3v` pin on the 'The Things Uno'
- The Button yellow cable is connected to the digital pin `4` (fifth pin in the pin header) on the 'The Things Uno'
- The Button black cable is connected to one of the `GND` pins on the 'The Things Uno'
- Note: The white cable of the button is not used
- The LED BAR red cable is connected to the `5v` pin on the 'The Things Uno'
- The LED BAR black cable is connected to one of the `GND` pins on the 'The Things Uno'
- The LED BAR yellow cable is connected to the digital pin `8` on the 'The Things Uno'
- The LED BAR white cable is connected to the digital pin `9` on the 'The Things Uno'

Your device and sensors should be connected as follows:

- LED pin layout

   ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/node-led.jpg)

## Read sensors

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture03-read-sensor-data.png)

We start with running a simple sketch on the Arduino. This is a program which simulates a machine and when you press a button it 'breaks down'.

1. **Copy** the zip file 'Grove_LED_Bar-master.zip' from [this OneDrive location](https://aka.ms/workshopiot) to a folder (you do _not_ have to **unzip** it)

2. Open the Arduino IDE

3. **Select** menu _Sketch, Include library, Add .ZIP Library_. A dialog to add a library is shown

4. Select the 'Grove_LED_Bar-master.zip' and select **Open**

5. **Check** if the library is imported correctly. A collection (of sketches) named 'Grove_LED_Bar-master' should appear in menu _File, Examples, Examples from Custom Libraries_

6. Connect The Things Uno via the micro USB cable to your computer

7. In the **Tools** menu, click **Board** and select **Arduino Leonardo**

8. In the **Tools** menu, click **Port** and select the serial port of your **COMx (Arduino Leonardo)**

9. Paste the following code in a new sketch:

    ```c
    #include <Grove_LED_Bar.h>

    #define debugSerial Serial

    int commButton = 4;
    int cycleCompleted = 0;
    int errorCode = 0;

    #define debugSerial Serial

    Grove_LED_Bar bar(9, 8, 0);  // Clock pin, Data pin, Orientation

    void setup()
    {
      debugSerial.begin(9600);

      pinMode(commButton, INPUT);

      delay(1000);

      debugSerial.println("Initializing");

      bar.begin();

      bar.setLed(1,1);
      delay(250);
      bar.setLed(1,0);
      bar.setLed(2, 1);
      delay(250);
      bar.setLed(2,0);

      for (int i = 3; i < 11; i++) {
        bar.setLed(i, 1);
        delay(250);
      };

      for (int i = 11; i > 2; i--) {
        bar.setLed(i, 0);
        delay(250);
      };

      bar.setLed(2,1);

      debugSerial.println("Led bar initialized");
    }

    void loop()
    {
      // Simulate police LED lights using setLed method
      for (float i = 0; i < 1.1; i += .100f) {
        bar.setLed(2, 1 - i);
        delay(150);
      };

      for (float i = 0; i < 1.1; i += .100f) {
        bar.setLed(2, i);
        delay(150);
      };

      // If not in error state, update the number of cycles
      if (errorCode == 0) {
        clearProgress(cycleCompleted);
        showProgress(cycleCompleted);
        cycleCompleted++;
        debugSerial.print("Cycle completed: ");
        debugSerial.println(cycleCompleted );
      }

      // In the button is pushed, the machine enters an error state
      if (digitalRead(commButton) == HIGH) {
        errorCode = 99;
        bar.setLed(1,1);
        debugSerial.print("Error occured: ");
        debugSerial.println( errorCode);
        debugSerial.println("Repair of machine needed...");
      }

      // Communicate with TTN about number of cycles and current state (error code)
      byte buffer[2];
      buffer[0] = (byte) cycleCompleted;
      buffer[1] = (byte) errorCode;

      delay(12000);
    }

    void showProgress(int i){
      switch(i % 5){
        case 0:
          bar.setLed(3,1);
          break;
        case 1:
          bar.setLed(4,1);
          break;
        case 2:
          bar.setLed(5,1);
          break;
        case 3:
          bar.setLed(6,1);
          break;
        case 4:
          bar.setLed(7,1);
          break;
      }
    }

    void clearProgress(int i){
      if ((i % 5) == 0) {
          bar.setLed(3,0);
          bar.setLed(4,0);
          bar.setLed(5,0);
          bar.setLed(6,0);
          bar.setLed(7,0);
      }
    }
    ```

10. In the **Sketch** menu, click **Verify/Compile**

11. Go to the **Tools** menu and open the **Serial Monitor**

12. Go back to the **Sketch** menu and click **Upload**

13. Once the sketch has been uploaded, You should see output like this.

14. Just wait a few seconds before pushing the button:

    ```cmd/sh
    Initializing
    Led bar initialized
    Cycle completed: 1
    Cycle completed: 2
    Cycle completed: 3
    ...
    Error occured: 99
    Repair of machine needed...
    ```

Now we have a running Arduino with some basic logic. Let's send some messages using The Things Network.

## Create The Things Network application in the The Things Network portal

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture04-create-a-ttn-device.png)

Follow the steps to create an application and register your device.

1. Log into the [The Things Network dashboard](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org) using a modern browser like Chrome. You will be asked to provide TTN credentials if needed
2. A selection between Applications maintenance and Gateways maintenance must be made. Choose **Applications**

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/TTN-app-gtwy.png)

3. A The Things Network application is a logical container of several devices, providing the same telemetry. There are no TTN applications yet

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications.png)

4. Add a new application. Pick a unique Application ID (for example `predictive_maintenance` in lower case) and fill in a description

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-add.png)

5. Press **Add application**. The application is added
6. Go to **Devices**

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices.png)

7. Click **Register device**
8. Enter a **Device ID** (for example `predictive_maintenance_machine_42` in lower case)

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices-name-only.png)

9. Notice that the Register button is still disabled. A device needs a unique identifier
10. Click the **Generate** icon for 'Device EUI' so a unique EUI can be generated on register

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices-before-register.png)

11. The text in the EUI textbox is changed

12. The register button is now enabled. Click **Register**

13. The device is now created

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices-registered-otaa.png)

14. Now we have to fine tune the settings

15. Click **Settings** in the upper right corner

16. Select activation method **ABP** instead of OTAA

17. And uncheck **Frame counter checks** *Note: As stated, Disabling frame counter checks drastically reduces security and should only be used for development purposes. In this workshop, this makes you more flexible*

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices-settings.png)

18. Click **Save**

19. The following device settings are shown

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices-ready.png)

20. Keep this page open, you need the device address, network session key and application session key in a minute

The TTN application is created. Your device has been registered and provisioned.

## Send telemetry from your device to the The Things Network platform

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture05-submit-data-to-ttn.png)

The sensor data is read, now it is time to send the sensor data to the The Things Network platform.

1. First we have to reference the The Thinks Network library for Arduino. **Open** the Arduino IDE

2. **Select** menu _Sketch, Include library, Manage Libraries_. A form named 'Library Manager' is shown

3. **Search** for The Things Network library using the keyword 'TheThingsNetwork'

4. A single library is shown. **Select** the library and **Install** the library

5. Close the Library manager

6. In the Arduino IDE, from the **File** menu, choose **New** to create a new sketch and paste the following code:

    ```c
    #include <Grove_LED_Bar.h>
    #include <TheThingsNetwork.h>

    const char *devAddr = "00000000";
    const char *nwkSKey = "00000000000000000000000000000000";
    const char *appSKey = "00000000000000000000000000000000";

    #define loraSerial Serial1
    #define debugSerial Serial

    #define freqPlan TTN_FP_EU868

    TheThingsNetwork ttn(loraSerial, debugSerial, freqPlan);

    int commButton = 4;
    int cycleCompleted = 0;
    int errorCode = 0;

    #define debugSerial Serial
    #define loraSerial Serial1

    Grove_LED_Bar bar(9, 8, 0);  // Clock pin, Data pin, Orientation

    void setup()
    {
      loraSerial.begin(57600);
      debugSerial.begin(9600);

      pinMode(commButton, INPUT);

      delay(1000);

      debugSerial.println("Initializing");

      // Initializing TTN communication...
      ttn.personalize(devAddr, nwkSKey, appSKey);

      debugSerial.println("The Things Network connected");
      // nothing to initialize
      bar.begin();

      bar.setLed(1,1);
      delay(250);
      bar.setLed(1,0);
      bar.setLed(2, 1);
      delay(250);
      bar.setLed(2,0);

      for (int i = 3; i < 11; i++) {
        bar.setLed(i, 1);
        delay(250);
      };

      for (int i = 11; i > 2; i--) {
        bar.setLed(i, 0);
        delay(250);
      };

      bar.setLed(2,1);

      debugSerial.println("Led bar initialized");
    }

    void loop()
    {
      // Simulate police LED lights using setLed method
      for (float i = 0; i < 1.1; i += .100f) {
        bar.setLed(2, 1 - i);
        delay(150);
      };

      for (float i = 0; i < 1.1; i += .100f) {
        bar.setLed(2, i);
        delay(150);
      };

      // If not in error state, update the number of cycles
      if (errorCode == 0) {
        clearProgress(cycleCompleted);
        showProgress(cycleCompleted);
        cycleCompleted++;
        debugSerial.print("Cycle completed: ");
        debugSerial.println(cycleCompleted );
      }

      // In the button is pushed, the machine enters an error state
      if (digitalRead(commButton) == HIGH) {
        errorCode = 99;
        bar.setLed(1,1);
        debugSerial.print("Error occured: ");
        debugSerial.println( errorCode);
        debugSerial.println("Repair of machine needed...");
      }

      // Communicate with TTN about number of cycles and current state (error code)
      byte buffer[2];
      buffer[0] = (byte) cycleCompleted;
      buffer[1] = (byte) errorCode;

      // send message to TTN
      ttn.sendBytes(buffer, sizeof(buffer));

      delay(12000);
    }

    void showProgress(int i){
      switch(i % 5){
        case 0:
          bar.setLed(3,1);
          break;
        case 1:
          bar.setLed(4,1);
          break;
        case 2:
          bar.setLed(5,1);
          break;
        case 3:
          bar.setLed(6,1);
          break;
        case 4:
          bar.setLed(7,1);
          break;
      }
    }

    void clearProgress(int i){
      if ((i % 5) == 0) {
          bar.setLed(3,0);
          bar.setLed(4,0);
          bar.setLed(5,0);
          bar.setLed(6,0);
          bar.setLed(7,0);
      }
    }
    ```

7. Insert your device address in `devAddr`, network session key in `nwkSkey` and application session key in `appSKey`. You can use the handy `clipboard` button in the dashboard to copy it quickly as a HEX value

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-applications-devices-credentials.png)

8. In the **Sketch** menu, click **Upload**
9. Open the **Serial Monitor** again from the **Tools** menu once upload has completed. Your device should now be sending telemetry to The Things Network

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-arduino-debug.png)

10. In The Things Network dashboard, go to **Data**. You see uplink packets arriving:

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-portal-raw-messages.png)

We are now receiving raw telemetry. We can decode and transform this in the TTN portal towards JSON messages.

## Decode data on TTN

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture06-decode-data-on-ttn.png)

Now, the hexidecimal payload is an efficient format for LoRa communication but it is not really useful upstream. We want human readable JSON. To decode and convert the hexidecimal payload to JSON messages, we have payload formats.

1. In the application overview, click **Payload Formats**
2. Add the following **decoder** payload format to decode the two bytes back to the decimal number of cycles completed and the current state:

    ```c
    function Decoder(bytes, port) {
      var cyclesCompleted = bytes[0];
      var errorCode = bytes[1];

      return {
        cyclesCompleted: cyclesCompleted,
        errorCode: errorCode
      };
    }
    ```

3. You have to test this decoder function before you can save the function. Enter eg. '2A00' in the payload and click **Test**. The hexidecimal payload entered is shown in JSON format as test result

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-portal-decoder.png)

4. We want to rearrange the order of the JSON elements. To rearrange the order we use the following function as the **converter** payload format:

    ```c
    function Converter(decoded, port) {
      return {
        errorCode: decoded.errorCode,
        numberOfCycles: decoded.cyclesCompleted
      };
    }
    ```

5. Again, you have to test this converter payload format before you can save the function. Again, enter eg. '2A00' in the payload and click **Test**. The hexidecimal payload entered is shown in JSON format with rearranged elements as test result

6. Finally, scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save**

7. Go back to your data overview. Now you should see something like this:

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-device-payload-fields.png)

Now we have clean JSON data ready to be processed in Azure IoT Hub and upstream.

## Configuring the Azure IoT platform to receive telemetry

Futher processing of the telemetry on the The Things Network platform is not possible. Processing telemetry has to be done on your own IoT plaform of your choice. In this case we choose the Azure IoT platform.

But first we need the secrets from the The Things Network platform to be able to create a secure connection between the two platforms. A secure connection between platforms is called a bridge. We will configure and deploy one.

### Collect TTN Application secrets

We have to collect unique keys of the The Things Network application.

1. Go to your The Things Network application **Overview** in the navigation bar
2. **Write down** the 'Application ID'
3. Scroll down to **Access Keys**. **Write down** the 'Access Key'

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/ttn-access-key.png)

The `Application ID` and `Access Key` are required to get data from The Things Network.

### Create an Azure IoT Hub

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture07-prepare-azure-integration.png)

Follow these steps to create an Azure IoT Hub.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). You will be asked to provide Azure credentials if needed
2. On the left, a number of common Azure services are shown. Select `More Services` to open a list with all available services

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-more-services.png)

3. Filter it with `IoT Hub`

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-search-iot-hub.png)

4. Select `IoT Hub` and a new blade will be shown. Select `Add` and you will be asked to enter the information needed to create an IoT Hub

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-portal-add.png)

5. Enter a unique IoT Hub name eg. `IoTWorkshop-ih`. A green sign will be shown if the name is unique

6. Enter a unique Resource Group eg. `IoTWorkshop-rg`. A green sign will be shown if the name is unique

7. Select `West Europe` for the location, if needed

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-new-iot-hub-scaled.png)

8. Press `Create` and the portal will start creating the service. Once it is created, a notification is shown. In the right upper corner, a bell represents the list of all notifications shown

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-notifications-iothub.png)

Creating an IoT Hub takes some time. Meanwhile, we will connect the device and create the bridge.

### Collect Azure IoT Hub secrets

The integration requires an Azure IoT Hub Shared access policy key name with `Registry read, write and Device connect` permissions. In this example, we use the **iothubowner** policy which has these permissions enabled by default.

1. Check the Azure portal. The resource group and the IoT Hub should be created by now (otherwise, we were unable to send duty cycles information to it)

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-notifications-iothub.png)

2. On the left, select `Resource groups`. A list of resource groups is shown

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-resource-groups.png)

3. Select the resource group `IoTWorkshop-rg`. It will open a new blade with all resources in this group

4. Select the IoT Hub `IoTWorkshop-ih`. It will open a new blade with the IoT Hub

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-iot-hub-initial.png)

5. The IoTHub has not received any messages yet. Check the general settings for `Shared access policies`

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-iot-hub-share-access-policy.png)

6. **Write down** the `name` of the IoT Hub eg. `IoTWorkshop-ih`

7. Navigate to the 'iothubowner' policy and **write down** this `Connection String-Primary Key`

    ![alt tag](img/UwpToIotHub/azure-iothubowner-policy.png)

This is the secret needed from the Azure IoT Hub.

## Create a bridge

![alt tag](img/msft/Picture08-build-a-bridge-frm-ttn-to-azure.png)

Telemetry is arriving at the TTN portal. But we want to pass it on to the Azure IoT Platform. We need to build a 'bridge'.

Follow these steps to create the integration bridge between The Things Network and Azure IoT Hub.

*Note: The bridge below is build using C# and will not run on non-windows devices. Use instead a bridge in the cloud as described in [Deploying The Things Network Bridge to Azure as a WebJob](Webjob.md)*

*Note: The bridge is actually an open source project on [github](https://github.com/sandervandevelde/TtnAzureBridge). We accept pull requests :-)*

1. **Create** a new folder eg. `c:\IoTWorkshop`

2. **Copy** the zip file 'TTNAzureBridge.zip' from [this OneDrive location](https://aka.ms/workshopiot) to this folder and **unzip** it _(Note: on some corporate networks, access to onedrive is limited. Ask the organization for a copy of the zip)_

    ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/bridge-download.png)

3. **Navigate** to the folder with the executable and identify the config file name 'TtnAzureBridge.exe.config'
4. **Open** this config file in notepad or another text file editor

5. **Replace** [TTN App Id] with the `TTN Application ID`

6. **Replace** [TTN App Access Key] with the `TTN Access Key`

7. **Replace** [iothub name] with the `name` of the IoT Hub in the app settings

8. In the connectionstring of 'IoTHub', **replace** [Connection String-Primary] with the remembered `Connection String-Primary Key`

   ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/bridge-config.png)

9. **Save** the config file and close the editor

The bridge is now ready for execution.

### Start the bridge

You are about to retrieve the telemetry from the The Things Network platform.

1. At the command prompt (press Windows button-R, type CMD and enter), navigate to the new folder `c:\iotworkshop`

2. In the same folder, **run** `TtnAzureBridge.exe` to verify the bridge is working

   ![alt tag](img/TheThingsNetwork/bridge-running.png)

3. This is example output:

    ```cmd/sh
    time 1/11/2017 8:16:29 PM -> IoT Hub IoTWorkshop-ih connected
    MQTT KeepAlivePeriod is 60000
    MQTT subscribed to predictive_maintenance on eu.thethings.network
    MQTT handling uplink
    Message received (2/predictive_maintenance_machine_42/eui-b827ebffffc19ca8/51.46018/5.61902/868.1/-76): {"errorCode":0,"numberOfCycles":3}-IoT Hub message sent
    MQTT handling uplink
    Message received (12/predictive_maintenance_machine_42/eui-b827ebffffc19ca8/51.46018/5.61902/868.1/-77): {"errorCode":0,"numberOfCycles":13}-IoT Hub message sent
    ...
    ```

4. The telemetry is passed to the connect Azure IoTHub. We also see some basic information about the frame count, the node, the name and location of the gateway, the Lora channel used and the quality of the reception (RSSI)

*Note: the message consists of valid JSON telemetry.*

*Note: Keep the bridge running until the end of the complete workshop.*

We can check the arrival of messages in the Azure IoT Hub. This can be done using a UI app named Device Explorer or using a Command-Line tool named IoT Hub Explorer. `Choose one below`

### Monitoring using UI

We can check the arrival of the messages in the Azure IoT Hub using the Device Explorer.

The Device Explorer tool is a Windows-only graphical tool for managing your devices in IoT Hub.

The easiest way to install the Device Explorer tool in your environment is to download the pre-built version by clicking [Azure IoT SDKs releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/releases). Scroll down to the Downloads section to locate the download link for the SetupDeviceExplorer.msi installer. Download and run the installer.

To run the Device Explorer tool, double-click the DeviceExplorer.exe file in Windows Explorer. The default installation folder for this application is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\DeviceExplorer.

1. Start the `Device Explorer` from the desktop or using the start menu

2. On the Configuration Tab, insert the IoT Hub `Connection String-primary key` and the `name` of the IoT Hub (as Protocol Gateway Hostname)

3. Press `Update`

4. On the Management tab, your device should already be available. It was registered by the bridge the very first time, telemetry arrived

5. On the Data tab, Select your `Device ID` (like 'predictive_maintenance_machine_42') and press `Monitor`

6. Now we check the leds on the device for `Sending cycle updates` a couple of times. This will result in the following messages while Duty Cycle telemetry is sent by the device

    ```cmd/sh
    Receiving events...predictive_maintenance_machine_42
    1/5/2017 9:46:18 PM> Device: [predictive_maintenance_machine_42], Data:[{"errorCode":0,"numberOfCycles":1}]
    1/5/2017 9:46:19 PM> Device: [predictive_maintenance_machine_42], Data:[{"errorCode":0,"numberOfCycles":2}]
    1/5/2017 9:46:20 PM> Device: [predictive_maintenance_machine_42], Data:[{"errorCode":0,"numberOfCycles":3}]
    ```

### Monitoring using Command-line

We can check the arrival of the messages in the Azure IoT Hub using the IoT Hub Explorer. This tool is Command-Line based, please check the installation requirements.

*Note: See the [full example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iothub-explorer) for more options of this tool.*

1. Create a new folder eg. `c:\iothubexplorer`

2. At the command prompt (press Windows button-R, type CMD and enter), navigate to the new folder `c:\iothubexplorer`

3. In this folder, run the following command `npm install -g iothub-explorer@latest` in your command-line environment, to install the latest (pre-release) version of the iothub-explorer tool

4. Login to the IoT Hub Explorer by supplying your *remembered* IoT Hub `Connection String-primary key` using the command `iothub-explorer login "[your connection string]"`

5. A session with the IoT Hub will start and it will last for approx. one hour:

    ```cmd/sh
    Session started, expires on Thu Jan 05 2017 22:53:55 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
    ```

6. To monitor the device-to-cloud messages from a device, use the following command `iothub-explorer monitor-events --login [your connection string]` and `fill in` your *remembered* IoT Hub 'Connection String-primary key'

7. All devices are monitored now. This will result in the following messages

    ```cmd/sh
    Monitoring events from all devices...
    From: predictive_maintenance_machine_42
    {
      "errorCode": 0,
      "numberOfCycles": 8
    }
    -------------------
    From: predictive_maintenance_machine_42
    {
      "errorCode": 0,
      "numberOfCycles": 9
    }
    -------------------
    ```

## Conclusion

The messages are shown here too. These messages are now available in Azure.
